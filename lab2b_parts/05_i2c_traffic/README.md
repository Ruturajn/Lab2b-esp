# I2C Traffic

- I2C is a serail, synchronous communication protocol, which can be seen from the images above, since the `SCL` or the clock signal drives the communication between the nodes.
- The oscilloscope was set to *digital* mode, for a more refined signal (without the noise).
- The logic analyser probe cables and normal probes were used to observe the digital signal on the oscilloscope.

The following screenshots show the I2C traffic between the Adafruit QTPy RP2040, and the APDS9960 sensor,
