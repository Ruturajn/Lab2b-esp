Following is the overview of the proposal for the expansion board,

### Outline
- The proposal is updated to  *guessing game* caled `higher_lower`, where the user is asked to enter a number that would be considered as a `seed` to generate a random
  number.
- Based on the generated random number whose function can be found [here](https://github.com/Ruturajn/Lab2b-esp/blob/main/higher_lower/ws2812.c#L19-L24).
- Then, the user is asked to enter a guess and based on whether the value entered is `higher` or `lower` than the random number generated, the user is prompted
  by printing `Think higher!!` or `Think Lower!!`.
- Until the user guesses the correct answer the `RED` LED blinks at each guess, once the user guesses the right answer the `BLUE` LED blinks, and the *game*
  mode is exited.

### Outline

The application is to light two different LEDs based on which character is sent to the **RP2040** (user input) using the *serial communication*. The **Qt Py RP2040** 
has `SCL1` and `SDA1` pins connected to `GPIO23` and `GPIO22` respectively, as seen from the Adafruit's documentation on the QTPy below (link to [documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-2040/pinouts)),

So, we will be using those `GPIO` pins to control our LEDs based on user input. 
- We initialize the both `GPIO22` and `GPIO23` as output pins using the `gpio_init()`, and the `gpio_set_dir()` functions. 
- Once the `GPIO` pins have been intialized, we can move on to the logic that decides which LED will glow. For that, the user's input is read using the 
`getchar_timeout_us(5000)` function, which returns a character from `stdin` if avaialable, within the timeout. 
- If the user presses `c`, the green LED lights up, and `GREEN SHOULD BE ON` is printed to serial out. Similarly if the user presses `d`, the blue LED lights up and 
`BLUE SHOULD BE ON` is printed to serial out. This can be seen from the demo above. 
- For driving the LEDs, the `GPIO` pins need to driven to a high or low state, this is achieved using the `gpio_put()` function.

This can be extended to be used as a password authenticator in lockers, where you are granted access whenever the right password is entered.
